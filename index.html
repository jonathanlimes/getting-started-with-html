    <h3><b><em>The Web</em></b></h3> The <b><u>Web</u></b> was created in the 1990s, and is now currently estimated to hold about 30 billion pages. It is basically a interwoven network of computers that communicate with each other.
    <br>The <b><u>Internet</u></b> is almost synonymous with the Web. It is a network of documents that are stored in <b><u>servers</u></b>. The internet is able to house all sorts of documents, such as plain text, HTML, links (references to other documents
    on the web), images, and videos.
    <br>How users commonly access them is through a <b><u>browser</u></b>, like Google Chrome.
    <br>How does a browser access documents on servers through the Internet? A browser communicates with a server using a medium of communication that we call <b><u>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</u></b>.

    <h3><b><em>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language</em></b></h3> HTML is made up of <b><u>plain text</u></b> (the actual content you see on the web page), as well as <b><u>markup</u></b> (how the content is visually presented on the web page - the <b><u>elements</u></b> of a web page).
    <br>To present content with the elements we want, such as italicizing each header just like this web page, we use <b><u>tags</u></b>.
    <br>Most tags need to be closed with a corresponding closing tag. Otherwise, the tags will apply to the rest of the text, and your content will be presented in ways that you don't actually want.
    <br>There are two types of HTML elements: <b><u>inline</u></b> and <b><u>block</u></b>. Inline elements format content within the same segment of the page. Block elements create a separate segment, or a 'box' in which content is housed. An example of
    a block element are the separate paragraphs you find on this web page.
    <br>There are also <b><u>attributes</u></b>, which allow you to provide additional instructions within some tags, such as to provide a link to another page.
    <br>There are tons of HTML tags, far more than we can remember at any given point of time. A simple Google search will usually give you the tags you need. A good reference document can be found <a href="http://htmldog.com/reference/htmltags/"><b>here</b></a>!

    <h3><b><em>Mental Models for a Programmer</em></b></h3>
    <li>Computers are said to be 'stupid', because they interpret all instructions literally. You cannot provide them vague pointers and expect them to infer their orders like humans usually do. They operate on a different dimension of knowledge. However,
      if you provide clear and structured instructions to a computer, it can act as a powerful tool.</li>
    <li>Programming requires systematic thinking and mental discipline. In the case of HTML, it is important to close all tags if they aren't void tags. Programmers need to develop good coding habits such as closing tags. </li>
    <li>There are too many details to keep everything in your head, and that is perfectly fine. Just look anything up on the Internet if you forget anything. It is your greatest common resource.</li>
